# GPS Emulator

This repository contains:

1. an API which exposes two endpoints for generating coordinates: one using the [Azure Maps Routes API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/maps/route) and one that generates them based on computations. This is implemented using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 

2. a documentation file [here](./docs/gps-emulator.md) that describes the implementation, usage and results
